      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>
        There are many people who are living in this world and everyone has different personalities. There are no two people who have the exactly same personalities. Everyone in this world is unique in their own ways. One's personality is something that does not change which makes one unique and special. As for me, I am a responsible and sympathetic person, however, I am a self-centered person as well who may have made enemies with a lot of people.
            I am a pretty responsible person and I do what I am supposed to do. As now, I am a student in school, therefore I do my homework every single day and study for what I have learned at home. I also pay attention in class most of the time as well. Besides that, I organize my work as well. At home, I am a child, so I respect my parents and help them to do house works, such as doing laundries and washing dishes. I clean my room once a week as well because that is my responsibility as being a child. I also help out friends and classmates when they need help. I give out advices and suggestions to them when they need support and help as well. Generally, I can say that I am a responsible person who does my duties.
